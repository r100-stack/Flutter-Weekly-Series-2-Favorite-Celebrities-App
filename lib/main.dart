// After deleting MyHomePage, the home attribute of the MaterialApp (MyApp) gives an error.
// Let's solve this my creating our own HomePage.

// In Dart/Flutter, the convention for a file's name is all small letters separated by "_"
// TODO (4): Create a file called home_screen.dart

// TODO (5): Type "stl" and select "New stateless widget"
// We will now create a stateless widget to represent our HomeScreen.
// TODO (6): Name the new widget as "HomeScreen"

// TODO (7): Now go to main.dart
// TODO (8): The "home" attribute of the MaterialApp (MyApp) should now point to the new widget.
